A serene and adorable cat is sitting on a wooden table, its fur a mesmerizing mix of gray and white. The cat's eyes are bright and curious, gazing straight ahead as if watching something fascinating. Its whiskers are long and slender, and its ears are perked up, as if listening to a faint sound. The table's surface is smooth and polished, with a few subtle scratches and scuffs that add character to the scene. A warm, soft light illuminates the entire setting, casting a cozy glow over the cat and the table.
